## My process

Given that this was a more complex component than the previous challenges, I wrote out an outline of the sections of the component and each element necessary. After sketching out an outline, I built out the html for the component. This went fairly smoothly and I planned to build the lists to be a reusable style.

Building out the structure for the whole component in css happened quite easily. I feel like I'm getting faster and the process is going smoother over all. The only real issue was the lists. At first I had planned to rely on the already existing list styles to create the look of the lists but I found the spacing that I wanted wouldn't quite work out properly so I used an html bullet entity with some flexbox and gap.

Finally, I put together the media queries for the component. This was mostly smooth going. Minor adjustments to make the component shift to filling the screen and text adjustments. But I got stumped on how to make the image responsive the way indicated. Moving it outside of the container wouldn't really solve the issue and so eventually I tried scaling the image and adding some margin bottom. This worked out perfectly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Mostly I just learned simple ways of adjusting the visual pieces necessary to the elements to the component.

### Continued development

I think I'm going to start using sass again as things get more complex. It keeps the code and files cleaner as I'm working.

On the side I'm also working on building a blog theme for my tumblr blog. I think this is good practice and also gives me a place to discuss my current web development endeavors.
